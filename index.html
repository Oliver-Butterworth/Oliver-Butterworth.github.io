    <h3>About Me</h3>
  </div>  
  <p>
  </p>
  
  
  I was born 15 June 2009 and have grown up and lived in London all my life. I love music, especially singing, and have been taking lessosn since the age of four. I have one brother - younger than me - and one sister who is 16 years old. Sadly, my sister 'lucia' sufferes from a very serioius neurological condition, and she has never been able to walk or talk. I love her and my brother very much, and together we have made some great memories. 
  
  <p>
  
  Most summers we go away, as a family, to America in a state called New Hampshire, which is just outside of Boston. Here, we stay in my Grandparents house and get to see all of my mother's family. We swim in the lake, that is only a 5 minute drive from the house, go water skiing and jump of high rocks.

  I have one pet - a dog - named Hasli. My brother and I had been asking for a dog, for years; until.... finally when we were away travelling as a family in Switzerland, they gave in and said "YES!" The region that we were staying in at the time, was called the 'Hasliberg Goldern' and this is where her name comes from. She is now one year old, and still very 'puppyish' I love her very much.

    <h3>Family Holidays!</h3>
  </div>  
  <p>
  </p>

 
  <div class="dest">
  As a family, we have travelled to many places all around the world: Italy, Fance, America, Germany, Switzerland, Wales and Spain. Holidays with my family are always very special, and I feel privlaged to be able to visit so many amazing places. Last Summer, we went to New York City, for a week; we climbed the Empire State, went to museums and took walks through the iconic 'Central Park.' We then drove - a six hour drive - back down the continent to a State near Boston, where we spent the rest of our Summer holiday, swimming, playing tennis and water skiing!

    But two years ago, when Covid said "NO!" to any sort of international travel, my family and I faced the twelve hour drive to Switzerland, during which we stopped three times along the way, at different areas in France. When we finally arrived, for four weeks we enjoyed: Hiking through the tall mountians, swimming in the alpine lakes, and going mount biking! This is was one my most memeroable summer's; it was something that we normally would never had done, and it was a new expirience for everyone, proving to be extremley enjoyable.
