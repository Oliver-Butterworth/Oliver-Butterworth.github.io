      <h3> My Love For Music</h3>
      <p> </p>
      
      Music is a really important aspect of my life. I love singing, both in choirs and solo pieces. It makes me feel relaxed, happy and for the few minutes in which the song lasts, all my problems seem as though they dissapear. I enjoy going to concerts and productions, whenever I get the chance to do so.

        Now that I go to such a great school with amazing music facilities, I sing in the choir, three times a week, plus one additional private singing lesson. These sessions have really helped me to improve my singing and take it to the 'next level.' Most Sunday's we do a Chapel Contenplation, which is where we sing all the songs we have learnt that week - or over a few weeks - putting them together, and making a service for parents and teachers to enjoy. I love this part of the choir, as it helps me when singing infront of larger groups of people.
